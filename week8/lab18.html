            The Internet addiction is really common nowadays. Most specifically, is the mobile phone Internet addiction. Have you ever held your phone
            or couple of hours and don't want to talk with people even sitting around you? Have you got paranoid or anxious when you can't use your phone?
            That might be some signs. There is still not medical disorder associated with it, but I got some news saying that a person is so focused on his
            phone that didn't notice the incoming cars and got hit. When got interviewed by the journalist, he said that he is too addicted to his phone, and
            using it no matter he was eating, walking or any other things that can got rest to use it. After being injured in such an accident, he made up his
            mind to give up the addiction. I might have some similar issue as him, but not so much extent.
