                <h1>Short-term goal</h1>
                <description>
                    My short-term goal is to grasp front-end knowledge as much as
                    possible, but it is really difficult since there are so many
                    terms and technical points need to memorize and practise. Other
                    than that, the trends of javascript framework is always changing.
                    So I need to build a solid understanding on all the fundamentals
                    and try to master one or two javascript framework.

                <h2>Long-term goal</h2>
                <description>
                    My long-term goal is to get enough technical knowledge and then
                    try to transit to management position. But it got a long way to achieve
                    that, first I need to be a qualified developer, and what's more important
                    is to learn management skills including how to manage people, how to
                    assign tasks to people fit most. I need to learn from current manager in
                    daily work and study book and videos.
